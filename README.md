# LLM-driven Adaptive E-learning Prototype

## Project Abstract

Traditional e-learning systems often fail to accommodate the diverse needs of learners, particularly those with disabilities, due to their one-size-fits-all user-interface design. This paper explores the use of Large Language Model (LLM) powered adaptive e-learning systems to enhance educational accessibility and inclusivity. Our conversationally-driven approach focuses on facilitating real-time adjustments to accommodate sensory, cognitive, and environmental differences. A web-based prototype demonstrates how the system can tailor educational content, adapt interfaces, and integrates accessibility features seamlessly. From initial observations, we find that this approach has the potential to improve inclusivity by catering to diverse differences, establishing a promising foundation for further development in adaptive e-learning research.
